I'm writing a 2D Tank game in pure JavaScript. The code will perpetually be a complete mess but hey, it works!

Current Mechanics:
  - Bullets bounce off the walls 1 time.
  - Bullets can destroy any entity which includes other bullets and yourself.
  - Enemies are currently stationary but will shoot at you if they have line of site.
